# Name Letter Distribution Application

This is a React application that when given a username and password returns the distribution of letters of the username.

I use Redux for state management.

I use Sass for styling. This code is kept in `src/styles`.

## How to run the application

We use webpack to build our application. When we develop, we can set webpack in watch mode:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start`
